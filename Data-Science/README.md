# Data Science

This folder contains all the data science projects that I have been completed in the module EE4211 Data Science and Internet-of-Things and external projects that I have work on.

The file EE4211 contains the python notebooks for the second assignment in EE4211. The goal of the assignment is to do analysis on gas consumption data for a city in Austin Texas and propose insights that are insteresting. This is an open-ended project and students are free to work on any aspect of the data that was given to them.
