# Verilog FPGA Programming

This is my repository for all my codes writen in Verilog programming language. The codes comes from multiple source such as the modules I have taken and my personal project. For copyright and space constraint reasons, I would not upload the entire Xilinx project into this repository. Instead, I would be uploading only the **source** code that I have written for the various project. The filenames that the codes are save in will give an idea on the description of projects that it was used for.
