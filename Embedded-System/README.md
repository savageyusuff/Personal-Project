# Embedded System Project

This repository holds the code for EE2024 Programming for Computer Interfaces (AY1617 S2). The embedded system platform used is LPC1760 Development Board.

Filename  | Description
------------- | -------------
Assignment1  | The aim of this project is to use assembly language to program a PID controller and compare its performance if C programming was used instead.
Assignment2  | The aim of the project is to create a warning system to detect elderly falling. This projects makes use of sensors such as accelerometer, light sensor and temperature sensor to detect different situations that might happen when an elderly falls. The project makes uses to interfacing concepts such as IC2, SPI and UART to communicate with the sensors, displays (7-seg & OLED) and the CPU.
